  This project comes without .XIB file and the Controller object to support that already set up.  It is assumed that   the reader is familiar with those parts of Cocoa programming so the mechanics of putting those parts together are    not discussed in this readme.


 Add a Scripting Bridge build rule to the project.

  The first thing to do is to set up Xcode to automatically generate the Scripting Bridge source for the application   you would like to target.
